For this challenge I frequently referenced activity 10 from day 3 of week 14. This helped guide me through some issues I had in building the functions.

Additionally, I utilized Xpert AI which was very helpful in troubleshooting, especially with some particularly frustrating snags, such as the use of "parseInt(sample)" when filtering the metadata.
